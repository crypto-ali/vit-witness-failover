The program will create a log file in this directory called, status.log.

If you set the logging to INFO it will be updated every minute when the script checks the chain
for your witness node's total missed blocks. If you run it on INFO, please remember to occasionally
delete the status.log file to keep file size down.

Otherwise run it in WARNING (default setting) and it will only log info when it takes action
to disable a witness, activate the backup, or if the system raises an exception.
